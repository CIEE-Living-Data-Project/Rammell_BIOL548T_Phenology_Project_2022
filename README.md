N. Rammellâ€™s repo for BIOL548T Phenology Project 2022

Fall 2022

This repo contains folders for the downloaded data, scripts, and manuscript files
used to create my reproducible class project. 

To reproduce the project, begin by opening the 'scripts' folder and running the 
'setup.R' script to install packages, create folders, and download data to the 
data folder. Then, the preregistration and manuscript files can be reproduced
from within the 'manuscripts' folder.
