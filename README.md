N. Rammellâ€™s repo for BIOL548T Phenology Project 2022

Fall 2022

This repo contains folders for the downloaded data, scripts, and manuscript files
used to create my reproducible class project. To reproduce the project, 
Download ZIP, open .RProj, install/load packages, and run the manuscript.Rmd to 
render the manuscript with data accessed directly from DRYAD.

Or, begin by opening the 'scripts' folder and running the 'setup.R' script to 
install packages, create folders, and download data to a data folder. Then, the 
figure can be rendered using the analysis.R script, and the preregistration and 
manuscript files can be reproduced from within the 'manuscripts' folder.
