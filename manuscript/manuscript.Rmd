## I have commented out the default YAML title and removed the author and data 
## info as I don't really as I don't want them to appear on the title page

# title: "Generic Manuscript Template"

# This sets up the format to match most journal requirements of 1" margins
# and 12pt Times new Roman font. The catch is that to specify the font
# you have to use the xelatex latex_engine. Also important to note, most 
# journals need Word files (or Latex) for copy editing. You can simply
# comment out lines (20, 21, 23 and 24) and uncomment the 
# word_document output. 

geometry: margin=1in
header-includes:
    - \usepackage{setspace}
    - \doublespacing
    - \usepackage{lineno}
    - \linenumbers
#   - \usepackage{fontspec}         # can only be used with xelatex output
#   - \setmainfont{Times New Roman} # can only be used with xelatex output

# output:
# pdf_document:
    latex_engine: xelatex
## Other output options are:
# output: pdf_document
# output: html_document
 output: word_document

## Specify your csl here. You can use local or remote 
## sources of csl files but local is better.
## below are two good sources of CSL files
## https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles
## https://www.zotero.org/styles

# csl: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/ecology-letters.csl
csl: https://www.zotero.org/styles/ecology-letters
# csl: "ecology-letters.csl"

# The .bib file allows you to add citations without Zotero and to share your
# library with co-authors so that everyone has the same list of potential
# references. Co-authors can just add new entries to the .bib file if they think
# a citation is relevant
