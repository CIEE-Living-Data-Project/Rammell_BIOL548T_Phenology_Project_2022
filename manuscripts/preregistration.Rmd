**STUDY INFORMATION**

**1. Title**

1.1 Effects of altered snowmelt timing on flowering phenology of Arctic plant species

**2. Authors** 

Nicola F. Rammell

**3. Description**

This study uses data from @blume-werryRootPhenologyUnresponsive2017 accessed from Dryad to plot flowering phenology of several Arctic plant species as a function of snowmelt timing. In this study, snowmelt was manipulated by removing snow from experimental plots to obtain earlier snowmelt dates. Data was collected during the 2014 growing season in Northern Sweden near the Abisko Scientific Research Station (68°210 N18°450 E). An improved understanding of how species will react to altered snowmelt is imperative in tundra environments where environmental change is driving rapid shifts in vegetation.

**4. Hypotheses**

4.1 Phenological development will advance with snowmelt date, though responses will be species specific.

**DESIGN PLAN**

**5. Study Type**

5.1 Experimental data.

**6. Blinding**

No blinding is involved in this study.

**7. Is there anything blinding in this study**

No.

**Study Design**

This study used a randomized blocked design.

**SAMPLING PLAN**

**10. Existing data**

Registration prior to analysis of data.

**11. Explanation of existing data**

Data were accessed from Dryad (https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061%2Fdryad.21bg6). Data were not explored prior to this analysis.

**12. Data collection procedures**

N/A

**13. Sample size**

Observations were collected for 124 individual plants across two treatment groups.

**ANALYSIS PLAN**

I will subset data to examine flowering phenology for all Arctic plant species included in the study. Flowering phenology will be plotted as a function of snowmelt date by species.
