**STUDY INFORMATION**

**1. Title**

1.1 Impacts of experimental warming on     alpine tundra plant flowering phenology

**2. Authors** 

Nicola F. Rammell

**3. Description**

This study uses data from Carbognani et al., 2018* accessed from Dryad to plot phenological development of three alpine plant species as a function of air temperature. In this study, temperature was manipulated using experimental warming to simulate climate warming of 1-3 degrees C. Data was collected in the Italian Alps during the 2010-2014 growing seasons. An improved understanding of how species will react to warming is imperative in tundra environments where climate warming is driving rapid shifts in vegetation.

**4. Hypotheses**

4.1 Phenological development will advance with warming, though responses will be species specific.

**DESIGN PLAN**

**5. Study Type**

5.1 Experimental data.

**6. Blinding**

No blinding is involved in this study.

**7. Is there anything blinding in this study**

No.

**Study Design**

This study used a randomized blocked design.

**SAMPLING PLAN**

**10. Existing data**

Registration prior to analysis of data.

**11. Explanation of existing data**

Data were accessed from Dryad (https://datadryad.org/stash). Data were not explored prior to this analysis.

**12. Data collection procedures**

N/A

**13. Sample size**

* *Cardamine alpina* = 687
* *Leucanthemopsis alpina* = 671
* *Veronica alpina* = 494

**ANALYSIS PLAN**

I will use a linear model to examine the impact of air temperature on phenological development for three tundra plant species. Data will be plotted by species.
