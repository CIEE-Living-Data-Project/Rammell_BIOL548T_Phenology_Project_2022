This script folder contains two scripts: 

  (1) "setup.R" which sets up the directories, installs and loads packages, and 
  downloads data from Dryad and saves it to a folder.
  
  (2) "analysis.R" which contains the code used to create the figure used in the manuscript.
  
To reproduce this project, begin by running the "setup.R" script to download data followed by the "analysis.R"
script.
